# Blueberry Winery

<h2>The Task</h2>
A purported winery startup from Portugal "approached" our learning group wishing to get fundamental business insights from wine data. The startup planned to start their business in the region of Vinho Verde but was still open to other suggestions. The questions were widly spread. From detection of wine quality derived from the given data over chemical differences in wine quality both in red and white wines, global wine comparisons to consultation in price setting and provision with overall wine market information - all of this was requested by the "client", including the consideration of most important KPIs.


<h2>The Data</h2>
At first we got one dataset for white and another for red wine from the Portugese Vinho Verde region. Both were very unbalanced with a data ratio of aproximately 2.5:1 for white to red wine.<br>
Later we got a third, a big dataset with sales and wine quality data for wines from all over the world. It was way to big to process it on a local computer. Nevertheless, a partional price exploration helped to understand a few phenomenons for certain countries.<br> 
<b>Spoiler Alert:</b> Relations between percieved wine quality and sales price could only be found for French wines.


<h2>The Tools</h2>
To solve the comprehensive tasks we used
<ul>
  <li>Python 3</li>
  <li>data analytics</li>
  <li>machine learning and</li>
  <li>data visualization</li>.
</ul>

Some of the explorations and analytics by machine learning as well as insights from global market research are displayed in the two presentations attached.
